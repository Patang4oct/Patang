            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p>Love is the foundation of our marriage, and we find inspiration in these quotes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Love is not about how many days, months, or years we have been together. It's all about how much we love each other every day." - Unknown</li>
                <li>"In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours. In all the world, there is no love for you like mine." - Maya Angelou</li>
                <li>"A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person." - Mignon McLaughlin</li>
                <li>"The best thing to hold onto in life is each other." - Audrey Hepburn</li>
            </ul>
